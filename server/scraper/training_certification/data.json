This course will also introduce students to MIMO communications and space time block codes which will be followed by multiuser systems and networks. Finally, the course will share insights and possible technologies for the next generation of wireless communication systems.",

Tools in GeoGebra are helpful in various constructions and calculations. Entry of equations and mapping of various variables can be done using the tools, input bar, CAS and spreadsheet views. Interactive explorations can be done using the tools in 2D and 3D Graphics modes.  GeoGebra is a very useful tool to learn and teach different branches of mathematics. GeoGebra desktop application are available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux and tablet appls are available for Android, iPad and Windows. Its web app is based on HTML5 technology. GeoGebra was created by Markus Hohenwarter and started as part of his master’s thesis at the University of Salzburg, continuing at Florida Atlantic University, Florida State University, and then at the University of Linz with the help of open-source developers and translators all over the world. Bernard Parisses’ Giac was integrated into GeoGebra’s CAS view in 2013. Both commercial and not-for-profit entities work together to expand the software and cloud services for users.   Contributors, Content Editors and Reviewers The Spoken Tutorial Effort for Applications for GeoGebra is being contributed by Dr. Vidhya Iyer. Ms. Madhuri Ganapathi from IIT Bombay created two tutorials and prepared the outline along with Ms. Shruti Arya and Mr. Kiran Eranki. Other contributors include Ms. Sandhya Punekar and Ms. Madhuri Ganapathi, who contributed as domain reviewers, Ms. Minal Sathaye, who was the novice and Ms. Nancy Varkey, the administrative reviewer.

Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board or microcontroller and a software, IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on the computer. It is used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.   Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins, USB connection which is used for loading programs from computers, power jack, reset button etc.   A program written with the IDE for Arduino is called a sketch. The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using special rules of code structuring. It consists of only two functions, setup and loop. The setup function is used to initialize variables, input and output pin modes and other libraries needed in the sketch. After setup has been called, function loop is executed repeatedly in the main program. It controls the board until the board is powered off or reset.   Arduino can interact with buttons, LEDs, motors, speakers, cameras, TV and smart phones etc. It can used for almost any electronics projects.   The Spoken Tutorial effort for Arduino has been contributed by Nirmala Venkat and Manivel from Spoken Tutorials team and Abhinav Dronamrajuand Brijesh Gupta from FOSSEE team.   The domain review of basic level is done by Srikant Patnaik from FOSSEE. The content for Intermediate level is contributed by Prof. Sharma from IIT Hyderabad."
